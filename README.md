# Project 1 - Rust Command Line Tool
The goal for this project is to build a random data generator that will generate a few vectors with a given amount of noise.
The first version of this tool allows the user to input a noise value and then generates a vector x with values between 0 and 100, a vector y with values between 0 and 100 with the noise value subtracted, and a vector z = x^2 + y. It will then return a message saying the data has been generated.
